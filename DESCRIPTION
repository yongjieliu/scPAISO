Title: scPAISO: Identification and Quantification of Alternative Polyadenylation Sites in Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Yongjie Liu
Maintainer: Yongjie Liu <yongjieliu.2016@gmail.com>
Description: Provides an end-to-end workflow that leverages both reads from 3' tag-based scRNA-seq for de novo mapping and quantification of polyadenylation sites. Enables the detection of both known and novel PASs, isoform-level quantification, and downstream visualization utilities.
